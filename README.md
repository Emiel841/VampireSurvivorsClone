# Vampire Survivors Clone

## Overview
This project is a **Python-based Vampire Survivors clone** built using the `pygame` library. Players navigate a top-down environment, battling waves of enemies while collecting pickups and leveling up. The game challenges players to survive as long as possible while managing health, shields, and increasing enemy difficulty.

## Features

### Core Mechanics
- **Player Movement:** Navigate the map using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.
- **Combat:** Utilize projectiles and melee weapons to defeat waves of enemies.
- **Leveling Up:** Gain experience points (XP) by defeating enemies to enhance your stats.
  
### Enemy System
- Multiple enemy types with varying health, size, and damage:
  - Basic enemies (green slimes)
  - Tank enemies (bit more hp than basic and a lot more damage)
  - Large Slimes (larger, tougher enemies)
  - Red slimes (slimes but fast and a bit more health and damage)

### Pickup Items
- **Shield:** Protects the player from one collision, kills the enemy the player collided with.
- **Medkit:** Restores health.

### Procedural Spawning
- Enemies and pickups spawn dynamically at randomized intervals and locations.
- Increasing difficulty over time:
  - Spawn frequency increases gradually.
  - New enemy types become available as the player's level increases.
